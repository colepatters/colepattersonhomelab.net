## Intro

### Foreword
Hi there! This is my first 'article' thingy I'm writing for my website. My aim is to be able to share some information I've discovered with anyone who might need it. I'm hoping you're finding this from a search or a link! If not, I hope you don't find this after you've gone through all the headache and trial and error that I have. 

### My Current Setup
When I originally set this up, it was about a year ago in 2022 when I installed TrueNAS Scale on my old tower PC after upgrading. Taking a look through the apps in there, I saw the Home Assistant app, and the rest is history. I've probably spent 100+ hours on HA, and I don't plan on stopping any time soon. Since then, I switched my NAS to some pre-owned server hardware, where it lives now at my parent's house, and I have my own setup in my apartment. Now that you've heard my life story, my current setup follows:

- Mac Mini (2016-era)
	- [HA SkyConnect](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Home-Assistant-SkyConnect-p-5479.html) (Gen1?)
	- [NooElec NESDR Nano 2+](https://a.co/d/fPTZlVL)
